# Bash auto full backup script
* [Single auto full backup](#single---general-info)
* [Multi auto full backup](#multi---general-info)

## Single - General info
This is a [simple bash script](auto-full-backup-single.sh) that backs up the files and zip them into a 7z archive, then counts the number of backup files in the specified folder when the amount is greater than the specified amount, then the script deletes the oldest backup file.

### Requirements
* 7z (you can use another archiver)
* task scheduler - e.g. cron (optionally)

### Configuration
To run this script, you need to:

1. Specify the files you want to backup, for example:
```
    BACKUP_FILES="/home/user"
```
2. Specify where to save the backup file, for example:
```
    BACKUP_DESTINATION="/media/data/backup/myuser"
```
3. Specify the amount of backup files to keep:
```
    MAX_BACKUP_FILES_AMOUNT=<AMOUNT>
```
4. (Optionally) Add automatic script execution to the schedule of tasks at a specified time, for example crontab:
```
* *  * * 1   <user>      /<path-to-scripts>/auto-full-backup-single.sh
```

## Multi - General info
This is a [second bash script](auto-full-backup-multi.sh) that backs up the files and zip them into a 7z archive, but it allows multiple files to be backed up at once run. The script will group all files/folders into seperate folders.

### Additional configuration

1. Specify the files you want to backup in the array separated by a space, optionally with a new line, for example:
```
    BACKUP_FILES=("/home/user/adam"
                  "/home/user/tom/notes"
                  "<PATH3>"
                  "<PATH4>")

                  BACKUP_FILES=("/home/user/adam" "/home/user/tom/notes" "<PATH3>" "<PATH4>")
```
2. BACKUP_DESTINATION and MAX_BACKUP_FILES_AMOUNT same as in first script.
